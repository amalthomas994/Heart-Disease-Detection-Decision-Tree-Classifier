# Heart Disease Detection with Decision Tree Classifier
Decision Tree Algorithm for heart disease classification.
Decision Trees are a supervised learning method used for classification and regression. 
- We create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. 
- The decision tree is like a tree with nodes. The branches depend on a number of factors. It splits data into branches like these till it achieves a threshold value. A decision tree consists of the root nodes, children nodes, and leaf nodes.
- Decision trees follow a top-down approach meaning that the root node of the tree is always at the top of the structure while the outcomes are represented by the tree leaves.
- Root nodes and sub nodes are determined via the Attribute selection measure or ASM. We use the Information Gain and Gini Index techniques for the ASM.
